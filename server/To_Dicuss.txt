Meeting with Tissa 4: 

1. 
Abstract - overview of problem is 3 lines
3 lines of what i have done
3 lines of results
Conclusion 1 line: impact of this model 
Summary of the entire project / half page 

introduction : indepth
Layout background and link to literature / survey papers 
Addres what others have done: their limitaitions and identify their gaps
Propose what you are going to do 
: introduce aims and objectives 
Say what yr going to do in the subsequent chapters 
2 to 3 pages 
Methods 1 and 2 â€¦.. Chapter 3 more detail on method is better


Refer datasets: 
List original. Ref to original down to source. 
How did you modify and what part are you using

Reference dataset considered: 
Ref compared dataset

Dataset: 
Mention also contains crab cakes. 
Justify why. The word cake there. Doesnt affect the overall process
This also in another way imrpove the learning process of the model. False negative 

Medium: 
Can cite 
Cite as a website 

Consider methodology: 
Overview what is available and the decision to use the one chosen .
Pros and cons, hence i chosen xxx
In depth of xxx. 
If chose y previously, also explain y 
Overall ones just explain briefly 

Watershed has limitation xxx. This is sovled by intellient scissors, hence it was chosen. 
Overview for watershed but in depth to intellgent scissors .


2. Dataset images: only from stock photos or google images / shoppee 
Comparing models is critical analysis: 
methodology and results

Dataset stock photo: 
Not enough photos 
Individually allowed ro use or not 

3. Storage
Reference his github 
Resources for htis available from xxxxx
Model in final report: 
Why was this model used but this one used all the way to findl 
Final reprot describe process of trial and error and addresses weakensses of eliminated models and hwy it was eliminated until the final one chosen .

 

Todo: 
1. remove ingredients from dataset to clean up the ingredients expected 
2. add title to dataset

Report Writing: 
1. 70 20 10 split: 
    https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2203/2203.06721.pdf

- Arugments: 
    - Dataset
    - implementation    
        - Did you focus on other parameters? 
        - Parameters have to start form somewhere (give lit review) - Models, layers etc
        - How was it fine tuned 
- Considered the use of VIT- visual transformer but it was only introduced late last year

Text Detection: 
- Write function to make TrOCR work or show weakness and prove it

Chatbot: 
- Find comparison of expressions or syntax:
- Measure relevance 
- Try language models

Recipe Recommendation: 
- Approaches and lit review for parameters 
- Summarise why it doenst work 
- Relevance 

Final Report: 
- For comparing, top 3 and narrow down

- Introduction: 
    - Whats out there
    - Narrow down dataset baking
- Lit Review:
    - Detail
    - Compare approaches 
- Implementations 
    - Implementations that didnt work
- Results: 
    - Decision tree for chatbot
    - the one chosen from lit reviews
    

To-Do:
chatbot: 
- tf-idf tokenizer
- naive bayes classificaiton 


Object detection: 
- resnet50
- mobilenet etc

text detection: 
confuction matrix as a parameter


    1. Progress Bar
        - make progress bar with text on current step

        - freeze buttons during progression to prevent excessive button pressing DONE

    2. Split detect mode
        - Save object mode and text mode preview images DONE
        - Set a preview image for object and text mode

    3. Info button to provide details on how to use

    4. Chatbot
        - Train chatbot to handle follow up questions  
        - ingredient list: print ingredient in a list DONE
            a
            b
            c
        - print directions in numerical DONE

            3. 

    5. Final Report 
        - Read interim feedback

    6. Refine models

    7. Keyword input 

Tissa: 22/2/24
    1. Upload image submit: 
        - do not use loading screen, use progress bar
        - freeze buttons during progression
        - make combine results and generate recipe happen only once, not for everyme object detectio nand text deteciton occur

    1.1 Save images uploaded to object and text mode DONE

    2. Use sample image as a preview example for the image uploader: 
        - use 1 image upload bin and a button to swap in and out. 

    3. Info button to provide details on how to use

    4. Chatbot: DONE
        - ingredients list: print ingredients in a list 
        - A
        - B
        - C

        - Directions: print numerical DONE
        - 1.
        - 2.
        - 3.

    5. Todo: 
        - Start writing final report DONE
        - refine 3 models
        - train chatbot to handle follow uploads
        - handle keyword input

    6. Final report: 
        - read interim feadback

High Priority: 
1. Rewrite aims and goals 
2. Compete BERT and GPT implementations

Tissa: 1/2/24
    1. Object Detection ResNet50 model issues: 
        - Test on public dataset to compare results and find the issues
        Update: Successfully trained a ResNet50 model - 8/2/24

    2. Text Detection: 
        - Must justify why come to tesseract
        - What ocr are out there - list top 3 based on articles and narrowed it to tessearct based on results .
        - Results showed me tesseract is better. 

    3. Recipe Recommendation: 
        - Argument wise: why is yours different from the others out there?
        - other ones are different how. 
        - Literature review: finding a flaw that contributes to why we do this? 

    4. Can the model differentiate sugar and salt 
        - Update: no it cannot - 8/2/24

    5. Language Model Approach: 
        - Get results by the end of the month.  
        - Literature review supporting this approach.

    6. Use of SEGP: 
        - Cite my segp final report 
    This method was originally presented here but is being used here with modifications 
    In what way modifications 

    7. No need database: 
        - future work for personalised exper

Object Detection:
Proposed apporach for object detection: 
Backwards filtering: Find images for whichever ingredients possible 
(Many ingredients simply cannot be found or do not have adequent amount of available images)
- Target to be roughly 60 classes. 

Missing / Cannot find images for certain ingredients.
Approach 1: Remove from recipe (may remove a lot)
Approach 2: Use text detection on labels
Approach 3: Generalise, example all types of flour under flour. (May cause issues recipe matching but can be fixed in NLP)
Approach 4: Find ingredients at supermarket and take pictures.

Object detection allocation:
The training part comprises 631 images (70%), 
the validation part comprises 179 images (20%), 
the testing part comprises 95 images (10%). 

The YOLOv5 model is trained on the Q-100 food ingredient dataset for 100 epochs, and it takes 9.5 h to complete

Object Detection ResNet50 model issues: 
    - Test on public dataset to compare results and find the issues
    - Result: Same dataset performed ok when performed on "categorical" class mode instead of "raw"

4/2/23
- New implementation has high accuracy and low loss but higher val accuracy then accuracy
- Issue may lie in dataset formation. Therefore, use dataset split to get perfect 80 20 ratio. 
- Functional with high accuracy and low loss. 

- Move on to refinement. Flour cannot be differentiate with salt etc

5/2/23
- Double down Resnet50: Fine way to implement window sliding.
- Yolov5: complete dataset
=========================================================================================
Text detection:
TR-OCR - backed by literature 
Tesseract - easy to implement
Requires more training, try to test with conjuction with object detection to output

Switch to Tesseract-OCR
- TR-OCR has a weakness that allows it to only read one line. Not ideal for this case. 
- Image processing (cropping/ flipping/ color change)

Must justify why come to tesseract
What ocr are out there - list top 3 based on articles and come to the conclusion of tesseract.

Saving recipe recommendation training code as pynb file because converting to python file causes issues.
Dimension mismatch, etc.. causes output to be different from pynb file.
